# CS 5665_project
# OpenVaccine - Covid-19 mRNA Vaccine Degredation Prediction
This is Kaggle project and the competition name is "OpenVaccine: Covid-19 mRNA Vaccine Degredation Prediction".

## In order to execute the project, follow the below mentioned steps:
1. Download the [ipynb file](https://github.com/manazirahsan1/cs5665_project/blob/main/openvaccine-both-gru-lstm-averaging.ipynb).
2. Load it into Kaggle notebook.
3. Execure it.
4. It will take data from Kaggle and extract the output file in the working directory.
